# topic-mapping

This is an experimental Python script that will convert JSON outputs from courtlistener.com into a directory of text files.  This directory will then suitable for ingested topic-mapping software such as the Stanford Natural Language Processing Group's Topic Modeling Tool. 

To use, ensure that you have a directory of json files.  Then, while in the same top-directory that contains the folder of JSON files, run jsontotext.py in the command line.  The result will be a folder of opinion text files.
